Planets
----

Planets' influence will be dictated by the population, and also the influential people in its range. 
Planets' influence could work that as it has larger influence, it would be able to control 
other planets with lesser influence in a range of that influence.
Missions will be a good way to either increase or decrease the influence of a planet.

Commodities
----

Inhabited planets will each have an individual market which will dictate which commodities each planet sells/buys. 
Some planets will be consumers, some planets will be producers, and there would be trade ships to transport these between planets.
